# edge-learner

A model and utility for learning market inefficiency patterns with minimal help of humans. It has not yet been decided what sort of model to use yet. It's being thought about and discussed on [the related BHW thread](https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/follow-me-as-i-create-an-ai-trading-bot-for-bitcoin-crypto.1116066/).



## TODO

-    Settle on a learning model.
-    Create an interactive charting environment to host the human interaction utility.
-    Create a charting utility capable of visually defining market inefficiencies.
-    Create or adopt a DSL for mathematically defining market inefficiencies.
-    Create a reinforcement model trading agent (Separate repo) which can utilize edge-learner.



## License

Edge-learner will not start with a commercially permissive license this time. If it works out well, it will probably wind up being a dual license situation. For now,  I'm placing a non-commercial license. There just isn't enough time for  me to work on a commercial permissive licensed project right now.  Approved contributors who put forward good work will be considered for  complimentary commercial licenses and other such agreements in the  future.
